        <p class="content">Word Swift offers your visitors the ability to read your content at an excellerated pace. The faster your readers can consume your content, the more they will read. It works by eliminating some of the key factors for why so many of us read slower than we'd like. Single words from an article are flashed on the screen, quickly and in succession, so as to eliminate the need for readers to move their eyes from word to word. Believe it or not, but this adds significantly to the time it takes to get through an article. Also, because the words are flashed so quickly, readers are also able to avoid subvocalization of words as they read. If you've ever noticed yourself "speaking" words to yourself as you read, that is subvocalization and it is entirely unnecessary and serves only to slow you down.
